/**
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
 * threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed
 * of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
 * StackOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop()
 * should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 * Follow up
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
 * <ul>Hints:
 *  <li>64: You wll need to keep track of the size of each substack. When one stack is full, your may
 *          need to create a new stack</li>
 *  <li>81: Popping an element a specific substack will mean that some stacks aren't at full capacity.
 *          Is this an issue? There's no right answer, but you should think about how to handle this.</li>
 * </ul>
